## Short description

### What's the problem?

Car Pricing
A fight for supremacy between giant automobile manufacturers and the independent producers and sellers of passenger cars, is in full swing. It has intensified not only competition but also the trend toward monopoly in an industry that, paradoxically, is at once highly competitive and highly concentrated. In this challenge, build a car pricing model so that auto-manufacturing companies can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy, etc. to meet certain price levels.

### How can technology help?
By building a car pricing model so that auto-manufacturing companies and their management can make some changes in the design of the cars, the business strategies and other factors involved accordingly to meet certain price levels.

### The idea

We can use the previous data and train it in a machine learning model, considering the various independent variables which covariates, through which auto-manufacturing companies can understand the price difference with respect to independent variables, so it will be easy for them to manipulate the design of cars, or making changes in the business strategies to meet the certain price levels.
